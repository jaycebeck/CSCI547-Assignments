In three dimensions or less, this means that the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. Typically we use the orthogonal basis of our standard x, y, and z, Cartesian coordinates, which allows us, if we combine them linearly, to represent any point in a 3D space. But any three orthogonal vectors can do the same. We will see this property is used in PCA to identify the dimensions of greatest variation in our data when we discuss dimensionality reduction."

In machine learning, we iterate over so much data that those loops can lead to significant slow downs if they are not computationally efficient. In Python, vectorizing code and relying on matrix operations with efficient tools like numpy is typically the faster approach. Of course, numpy relies on loops to complete the computation, but this is at a lower level of programming (typically in C), and therefore is much more efficient. This exercise will explore the benefits of vectorization. Since many machine learning techniques rely on matrix operations, it's helpful to begin thinking about implementing algorithms using vector forms.\n",

You can even use some Git repositories (e.g. Github) as hosts for website, such as with the [course website](https://kylebradbury.github.io/ids705/index.html). As a data scientist with experience in machine learning, Git is expected.

Your goal is to identify a question or problem and to work towards solving it or providing additional information or evidence (data) related to it through your data analysis. Below, we walk through a process to follow for your analysis. Additionally, you can find an [example of a well-done exploratory data analysis here from past years](https://github.com/kylebradbury/ids705/blob/master/assignments/Assignment_1_Q11_Example.ipynb).\n",

Please exercise creativity and curiosity in your plots. You should have at least a ~3 plots exploring the data in different ways.\n",

Summarize this for a general audience (imagine your publishing a blog post online) - boil down your findings in a way that is accessible, but still accurate.\n",
